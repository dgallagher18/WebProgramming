		<h3>What is the Oculus?</h3>
		<p> The Oculus is the main station house of the World <br>
		Trade Center Transportation Hub. The station was originally <br>
		named Hudson Terminal, and was built in 1909, torn down, <br>
		and rebuilt in 1971. Following the September 11th, 2001 attacks, <br>
		a temporary station opened in 2003. The Oculus debuted on <br>
		March 4, 2016.<br></p>

				<li>PATH train</li>
				<li>A, C, E lines</li>
				<li>2, 3 lines</li>
				<li>4, 5 lines</li>

				<li>R, W lines</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		
		<p>The Oculus was designed by Santiago Calatrava, a Spanish architect,<br> structural engineer, sculptor and painter. Calatrava said that the Oculus resembles<br> a bird being released from a child's hand. The roof was originally designed<br> to mechanically open to increase light and ventilation to the enclosed space.<br>
		The transportation hub is one of the most expensive constructions of it's <br>
		kind, costing $3.74 billion dollars. The structure is commonly criticized for<br>
		it's tremendous cost, achitectural design, and the constructions 10 year delay.<br>
		However, many critics are more than pleased with it's turnout. <br>
		Herbert Munschamp of <i>The New York Times</i> wrote:</p>

		<!--Use of new tag called blockquote-->
		<blockquote>"Santiago Calatrava's design for the World Trade Center PATH station should satisfy those who believe that buildings planned for ground zero must aspire to a spiritual dimension. Over the years, many people have discerned a metaphysical element in Mr. Calatrava's work. I hope New Yorkers will detect its presence, too. With deep appreciation, I congratulate the Port Authority for commissioning Mr. Calatrava, the great Spanish architect and engineer, to design a building with the power to shape the future of New York. It is a pleasure to report, for once, that public officials are not overstating the case when they describe a design as breathtaking."</blockquote>
